## I'm a full stack developer & lawyer based in Argentina

I deliver solutions using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, React, PSQL, Firebase, HTML and CSS. 

I consider that technology is the right path to improve people‚Äôs lives, that‚Äôs the reason why I decided to change my professional career. I'm pasionate about Web 3.0 and Blockchain Technology. I believe in the potential of this technology and the ecosistem to change social paradigms and design efficient solutions. 

I have everything you need to enhance your project: passion for innovation, ideals, energy and an inexhaustible curiosity that I feed every day learning new things in many online platforms. Having a method to accomplish all purposes is what defines me: I thruly believe in the value of designing a plan to achieve every goal. That's why I am Notion enthusiast. From time to time I create content in my Medium Blog.

I want to work in a team, to investigate and contribute with proposals that pushes the team forward, and to continue developing my technical and soft skills.
